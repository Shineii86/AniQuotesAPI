## Adding New Quotes <a name="adding-new-quotes"></a>
To add new quotes:

2. Add your quote using this format:
   ```json
   {
     "id": 123,
     "quote": "Your quote here",
     "anime": "Anime Title",
     "character": "Character Name",
     "language": "en"
   }
   ```
   
3. Guidelines:
   - Use the next available ID (check the last ID in the file and increment by 1)
   - Verify the anime title and character name are accurate
   - Keep quotes authentic (from actual anime)
   - Maintain consistent formatting
   - Add only one quote per pull request (unless they're related)

   ```json
   {
     "id": 123,
     "quote": "Translated quote here",
     "anime": "Anime Title (in target language if applicable)",
     "character": "Character Name",
     "language": "target-language-code"
